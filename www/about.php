<h3>The original Syndicate introduction:</h3>

<p>As the world's multinational corporations grew, their profits began to rival
those of small countries. Soon they owned small countries and corporate
influence was felt at the highest level of world government. Smaller
corporations were swallowed up like plankton in the wake of three behemoth
mega-corporations, one U.S.-based, one Europe-based and one based in the Far
East. These became the only effective world government, unelected, undemocratic,
but controlling the lives of the people through commerce.</p>

<p>Then the European corporation perfected the CHIP. Inserted in the neck, the
CHIP stimulated the brain stem to alter your every perception of the outside
world. Better than any drug, the CHIP gave hope to millions by numbing their
senses to the misery and squalor around them. One CHIP would convince users that
the sun shone and the birds sang even as they walked through the constant acid
rain drizzle. Another that they were glamorous or handsome - they'd look in the
mirror and see a different face - while the rest of the world would see them as
they really were.</p>

<p>The CHIP was a technological revolution and sold countless units with the
slogan "Why change your world when you can change your mind". It also left the
user open to auto-suggestion and gave the corporations the perfect tool for
manipulating the populace.</p>

<p>Like any new and potent drug, control of the CHIP meant control of the
people. Soon the corporations were at war among themselves, desperate to
monopolize CHIP manufacture. But the corporations' thirst for power left them
open to infiltration.</p>

<p>With money earned through pirating CHIP technology, crime Syndicates bribed
and murdered their way into corporation boardrooms. It wasn't long before the
Syndicates became the controlling force all over the globe, with a finger in the
pie of every transaction, criminal or otherwise, worldwide.</p>

<p>And in the crime Syndicates of tomorrow those in control don't need uzis for
back up. Teams of custom-built cyborg agents hunt down rivals and traitors, and
spread the influence of the Syndicates across the globe.</p>
